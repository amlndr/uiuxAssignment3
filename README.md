The code file is in the master branch, along with how to run it locally on the computer. The project itself started by having an idea to make a platform for donating books online, and that the books will be collected by the company that I call "donateBook". After creating the idea, I made a high fidelity prototype which can be seen here. https://xd.adobe.com/view/7bef83af-b75e-4b1b-a63a-a02b73533079-2ebc/

The main features that were planned are:
1. Donate a book form
2. track donation progress

The design has been changed as there wasn't enough time. The feature of "track donation progress" is not implemented.
